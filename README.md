## Install
OS: Ubuntu
Make sure your machine have gcc and g++ and other essentials installed.
Then just type `make` in terminal, it will generate two excutable files

## Usage
On server side, to start the server:

`./server [-p port_number]`

e.g. `./server -p 8000` and the server will be waiting at port 8000.


On client side:

`./client [-d destination_ip_address] [-p port_number] [-f file_name]`

e.g. `./client -d 3.129.62.167 -p 8000 -f data.bin` and the cilent will connect to exact server as the IP address specifies.


Use the following command to change the delay and loss rate:

`sudo tc qdisc change dev ens5 root netem limit 100000 delay 100ms loss 1%`


## Clean up
Type `make clean` to remove all "*.o" and excutable files.
